In this assignment,I have create a trait Queue which performs two functions of enqueue and dequeue.

Then define two classes which name given as DoubleQueue and SquareQueue and mix in the trait.

DoubleQueue enqueues the element after doubling and SquareQueue enqueues the element after squaring them.


dequeue method will remove the first element from the queue(having concrete definition in trait Queue).
